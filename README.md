# PyBer_Analysis

# Analysis of Ride share data for PyBer Inc.

## Overview 
Ride share data was analyzed using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib to determine how availability, usage and fares vary between Urban, Suburban and Rural areas.  
A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type was used to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Data 
1. Urban areas have the greater number of riders with 1,625, total number of drivers 2,405, and higher total fares generated with $39,854,38 generated. The average fare per ride and per driver are the lowest of the three city types with $24.53 and $16.57 respectively. 

2. Suburban areas less than half the number of riders (1,625), total number of drivers (490) and generates nearly half of the total fares generated by Urban areas ($19,356.33). The average fare per ride is a fraction higher than for urban areas ($30.97) but the fare per driver is almost twice that of urban areas ($39.50).

3. Rural areas have the lowest number of riders (125), total number of drivers (478) and generates a small fraction of the total ($4,327.93). The average fare per ride is the higher of all three ($34.62). since there are so few drivers, the but the fare per driver is almost three times that of urban areas ($55.49).


## Summary:
From this data, the following recommendations could help address disparities among the city types:
* Incentives to recruit drivers in Rural areas would increase service availability and use. 
* Advertisement to increase usage and suburban areas.
* Offer promotional discounts on suburban and rural areas to lower the average fare price and promote usage.
